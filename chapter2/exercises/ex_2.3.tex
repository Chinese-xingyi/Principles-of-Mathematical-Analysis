% === Exercise 2.3 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
Suppose to contrary that all real numbers are algebraic, then the set of all real numbers called $\mathbb{R}$ is countable by Exercise 2.2. However, this contradicts that $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable; hence there exist real numbers which are not algebraic.
\end{proof}
