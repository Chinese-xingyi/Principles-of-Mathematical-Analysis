% === Exercise 2.4 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
No. 

Suppose to contrary that the set of all irrational numbers is countable. By the corollary of Theorem 2.13, we know the set of all rational numbers is countable. Then the union of all irrational numbers and all rational numbers is $\mathbb{R}$ which is uncountable. This contradicts the supposition.
\end{proof}
