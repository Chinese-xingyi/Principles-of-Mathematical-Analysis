% === Exercise 2.2 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
Continue with the hint, we let $A_N$ be the set of finitely many equations with
$$
n+|a_0|+|a_1|+\cdots+|a_n| = N.
$$
Then the set of all algebraic numbers is 
$$
\bigcup_{N=1}^{\infty}A_N.
$$

Since $A_N$ is a countable set for any $N\in\mathbb{N}$, by Theorem 2.12, we know $\bigcup_{N=1}^{\infty}A_N$ is countable which means the set of all algebraic numbers is countable.
\end{proof}
