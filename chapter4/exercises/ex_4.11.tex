\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $\{x_n\}$ be an arbitrary Cauchy sequence in $X$, then given $\epsilon>0$, there exists $N,\delta>0$ such that
		$$
		n,m\geq N \implies d_X(x_n,x_m)<\delta.
		$$
		Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, by definition, we know
		$$
		d_X(x_n,x_m) <\delta \implies d_Y(f(x_n),f(x_m)) < \epsilon.
		$$
		Hence
		$$
		n,m\geq N \implies d_Y(f(x_n),f(x_m))<\epsilon.
		$$
		This means $\{f(x_n)\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $Y$. Since $\{x_n\}$ was arbitrary, we complete the proof.
	\end{proof}
