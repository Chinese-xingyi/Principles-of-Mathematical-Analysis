\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $f_n\to f$ uniformly on a set $E$ and $f_n$ is bounded for each $n$.
		That is, for each $n$, there exists $M_n > 0$ such that
		$$
		|f_n(x)| \leq M_n
		$$
		for all $x\in E$; besides, given $\epsilon = 1$, there exists $N>0$ such that
		$$
		m,n \geq N \implies |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < 1
		$$
		for all $x\in E$.
		Hence for $n\geq N$, we have
		$$
		|f_n(x)|
		\leq |f_n(x) - f_N(x)| + |f_N(x)| + |f_N(x)|
		\leq 1 + M_N.
		$$
		Pick $M' := \max\{M_1,M_2,\cdots,M_{N-1}\}$, then we know
		$$
		|f_n(x)| \leq M_n \leq M' \mbox{ , } n=1,2,\cdots,N-1
		$$
		for all $x\in E$. 
		Finally, we pick $M := \max\{1 + M_N, M'\}$ to get
		$$
		|f_n(x)| \leq M \mbox{ , } \forall x\in E,\ n=1,2,\cdots.
		$$
		Hence we conclude $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly bounded.
