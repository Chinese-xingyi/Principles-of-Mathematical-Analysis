% === Exercise 5.3 ===
\begin{Exercise}
\begin{proof}
Pick $\epsilon$ so small that $|\epsilon| < \frac{1}{M}$.
Since $x$ is differentiable and hence $f(x) = x + \epsilon g(x)$ is differentiable.
It follows that
$$
f'(x) = 1 + \epsilon g'(x).
$$
Then
$$
|\epsilon g'(x)| \leq |\epsilon| M < \frac{1}{M} M = 1.
$$
Hence $0 < f'(x) < 2$.
We know $f$ is strictly increasing and hence is one-to-one.
\end{proof}
