% === Exercise 5.4 ===
\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{proof}
		Put
		$$
		f(x) = C_0 x + \frac{C_1}{2} x^2 + \cdots + \frac{C_n}{n+1} x^{n+1}.
		$$
		This implies that
		$$
		f'(x) = C_0 + C_1 x + \cdots + C_n x^n.
		$$
		Observe that
		$$
		f(0) = f(1) = 0.
		$$
		By the Mean Value Theorem, we know there exists $c\in(0,1)$ such that
		$$
		f(1) - f(0) = f'(c) (1-0).
		$$
		Hence 
		$$
		C_0 + C_1 x + \cdots + C_n x^n
		$$
		has at least one real root between $0$ and $1$.
	\end{proof}
