	These solutions were done as a student who is fresh out of university.
	Now I'm studying the book when serving my mandatory military service.
	
	\vspace{2ex}
	
	The solutions might be brief, however I state them as clearly as possible I can.
	For the computation parts, I might omit details about them because they are tedious but simple.
	
	\vspace{2ex}
	
	This material now only contains some selected solutions. 
	If there is something vague or incredible, it is possible that it doesn't make sense since it is wrong.
	If you have any suggestions or corrections to solutions, please direct to email "chengmao.lee@gmail.com".
	Your intelligence will be highly appreciated.
	
	\vspace{2ex}
	
	Hope this material could share some constructive ideas or help you that given important hints to solve problems by yourselves, or just verify whether the answers are consistent or not.
	
	\vspace{2ex}
	
	Any way, I hope everybody has good luck and fun in solving problems!
