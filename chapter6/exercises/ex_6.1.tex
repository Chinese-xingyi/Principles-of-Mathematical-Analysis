% === Exercise 6.1 ===
\begin{Exercise}
	\begin{proof}
		Since $|f(x)| \leq 1$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$, we know $f$ is bounded.
		$f$ is discontinuous at $x_0$, however $\alpha$ is continuous at $x_0$.
		By Theorem 6.10, $f\in\mathcal{R}$ follows.
		
		Consider arbitrary partition of $[a,b]$ which contains a point other than $x_0$, we know $m_i=0$ for all intervals. Hence
		$$
		\int_{a}^{b} f\,d\alpha 
		= \lowint_{a}^{b} f\,d\alpha
		= 0
		$$
		which is the desired result.
	\end{proof}
